# API

`openapi.json` is generated — never hand-edit. Regenerate with `make gen-api`; CI's
`openapi-drift` job fails when the committed file differs from the app.

- Base path: `https://api.csmarket.uz/api/v1`. Probes: `/healthz` (liveness), `/readyz`
  (readiness: Postgres + Redis, 503 when either fails). `/metrics` is scraped on the
  internal network and answers 404 from the public host.
- Errors: RFC 7807 `application/problem+json` with `type` under `https://csmarket.uz/errors/`;
  429s carry `Retry-After`.
- Every state-changing endpoint accepts `Idempotency-Key` (≥ 16 chars) — spec §13.

## Auth (M1)

Steam OpenID is the only sign-in (ADR-0004). The flow, in short:

1. `GET /auth/steam/start?app=web|admin&locale=ru|uz|en` — a top-level navigation, not
   an XHR. 302 to Steam and sets the `csmarket_oid` sign-in nonce cookie (`HttpOnly`, 10
   min); Steam returns the browser to the **app's** `/auth/steam/callback?locale=…&n=…`,
   not to the API.
2. `POST /auth/steam` `{app, params}` — the app forwards only the `openid.*` params, with
   credentials (`include`) so the nonce cookie goes along. The API requires the signed
   `return_to` to carry the cookie's nonce (else 401, nothing written), verifies with Steam
   and answers `{access_token, expires_in}` plus the cookie. The nonce is single-use: a
   failed attempt restarts from step 1.
3. Every other call sends `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.

- **Access token:** EdDSA JWT, 15 minutes, in the JSON body. Keep it in memory; never in a
  cookie or `localStorage`. Roles are not in the token; the server reads them per request.
- **Refresh:** `POST /auth/refresh` with the `csmarket_refresh` cookie (`HttpOnly`,
  `SameSite=Lax`, 30 days, `.csmarket.uz` in prod). Rotates on every use; reusing an old
  cookie revokes every session of the user. Send requests with credentials (`include`).
- **A failed refresh:** only `401` / `403` mean the session is over. A `5xx`, `429` or a
  network error is transient: keep the hint and do not call logout.
- **Sign-out:** `POST /auth/logout` (204, idempotent) revokes the session and the Bearer.
- **Keyless writes.** `/auth/steam`, `/auth/refresh`, `/auth/logout` and
  `/me/trade-link/check` take no `Idempotency-Key`; each says why in its docstring.
  `PATCH /me` and `PUT /me/trade-link` take one.
- **`/auth/dev-login`** is not in this schema. It exists only when dev login is on and the
  environment is not prod; 404 otherwise.

### Me and trade link

- `GET /me` — the owner's profile, roles and trade link with its last verdict.
- `PATCH /me` `{locale?, email?}` — omitted = unchanged, `null` clears; a new email is
  unverified.
- `PUT /me/trade-link` `{url}` — saves without calling anyone. A different link clears the
  previous verdict, reason and `checked_at`; re-saving the same link keeps them.
- `POST /me/trade-link/check` — advisory. `verdict` is `ok`, `warn` or `bad`, or `null`
  when the check was unavailable; `reason` is `invalid`, `private`, `trade_ban`, `hold` or
  `unavailable`. Cached 10 minutes; 4 s upstream timeouts.

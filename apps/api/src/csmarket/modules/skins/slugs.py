"""Slugs that stay unique when two names fold to the same ASCII text.

``naming.slug_for`` drops non-ASCII and lower-cases, so real names collide:
``Sunset Storm 壱``/``弐``, ``Sticker | NiKo``/``Sticker | niko  ``. A slug is
assigned once, when the row is first written, and never changes after that
(it is a URL); a newcomer whose plain slug is taken by a different item gets
a short hash of its own name appended.
